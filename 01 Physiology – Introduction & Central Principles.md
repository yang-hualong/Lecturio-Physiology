#### 01 总论

00:00
在这里，我们将讨论生理学及其一般原理。现在你可能在想 在这一点上，生理学到底是什么。因此，让我们先解决这个问题。生理是 生命科学。生理学本质上是相当广泛的，旨在了解其机理 从基因和分子到细胞再到细胞 功能并最终融入整个身体的行为。另一件事是 与生理学相关的重要考虑因素是人体在正常条件下的工作方式。 为什么这很重要，是稍后我们要区分正常生理和 医学生理学。生理几乎用于您在日常生活中所做的一切，从是否 您正在散步或锻炼，无论是阅读还是观看 特别的Lecturio讲座。它几乎完成了所有事情。现在让我们定义什么是 医学生理学与常规生理学的区别。在医学生理学中， 我最喜欢的报价是由一个调查小组完成的，该调查小组首先发现了动脉 在这种情况下，他们决定使用重症监护药物 生理原则来照顾重病患者。因此，在医学生理学上，我们将 更详细地讨论一些主题，并深入探讨，因为它们在医学上更 相关的。生理学中有一些主题，但是，我们将仅解释概念，因此您 了解它是如何工作的，但我们不会以相同的方式进行深入研究，因为它更少 在医学上很重要。好的，现在让我们将这些主题放在一起，然后通过 我们需要讨论的各个领域或系统。一般生理将是那些 经历身体的所有器官系统。神经系统将是大脑，脊柱 绳索和神经，这些有助于控制和调节其他器官系统 其他器官系统包括肌肉骨骼系统。所以就肌肉系统而言 这就是肌肉的收缩，它们如何拉动骨骼杠杆，这样您就可以 走路，走路，做日常生活的各种活动。但是，要做正常的活动 你需要新陈代谢。为了进行新陈代谢，我们需要有氧气，这就是 呼吸系统起作用。在这里，呼吸系统在 环境，进入人体和肺部，您将能够吸收氧气并 您将能够消除二氧化碳。您如何将氧气吸收到体内所有细胞周围 涉及心血管系统。所以在这里，我们将有心脏在抽血。现在就这样 将血液泵送到全身，您需要拥有脉管系统或输液管， 将血液输送到整个身体，每个细胞的扩散距离都足够近 接收氧气。肾脏系统在血液过滤中非常重要。 因此，就像呼吸系统正在添加物质一样，肾脏系统也会被去除 代谢过量或底物。胃肠道系统很好，因为它可以添加各种营养素 根据人体细胞的需要，例如葡萄糖。最后，内分泌系统将 类似于神经系统的调节系统中的另一种控制方法对我们有帮助 将所有各种器官系统整合到体内。现在让我们讨论这些器官系统 以及它们如何在流程图中相互联系。在这里你可以看到身体是 在许多不同的层中进行设置。我们这里的顶层是肺，这是 当然，二氧化碳将离开而氧气将进入。请注意，心脏是 一分为二，心脏的右侧将血液泵入肺部，我们的左侧 心脏在整个系统中移动血液。肾脏系统将位于第三位 梯级，这又是我们的过滤系统。在第二梯级，我们有胃肠道 系统，它将再次成为血液吸收营养的地方 葡萄糖，蛋白质，脂肪，然后可以传递到人体的所有细胞。终于在 最低的横档，我们有毛细血管床，这表示体内的所有不同细胞 以及每个人将如何接受其中含有氧气，营养物质的血液，并且 过滤良好，因此可以进行相应的正常活动 系统，无论是神经系统，肌肉骨骼系统还是内分泌系统。


#### 02 稳态

现在是我们需要按照中心原则进行讨论的过程。中央 生理原理基本上是体内平衡，但我们都需要在同一页面上 稳态实际上意味着。这是生物系统维持的受控过程 在各种压力或压力下动态但相对一致的内部条件 由外部和内部因素引起。有很多事情要考虑，所以让我们谈谈吧 通过这些过程中的每个过程，我们将了解这个定义是什么。 首先要考虑的是身体的哪些变量对您足够重要 真正规范他们。如果您想一想这几秒钟，其中一个 在我看来是葡萄糖。因此，您需要调节血液中的葡萄糖量，以便 最佳量被递送到体内的每个细胞。氧气也是如此。 氧气需要输送到体内的每个细胞，需要进行精确调节。 您如何确保身体各个部位获得足够的氧气和葡萄糖？ 您需要有足够的血压或压力才能将血液推到各个部位。 这些是3个非常好的例子。其他您可能尚未想到的 包括调节体温，调节pH平衡等 我们需要调节的整数变量。现在，关于定义的另一件事是 认为我们应该多讨论一些似乎矛盾的地方，因为两者都是动态的 并保持一致，这就是我们的意思。这不是一个特定的数字，而是 在医学中很重要的一系列数字。例如，葡萄糖水平不 将是一个数字，而是一个范围。血压不仅仅是我们的一个数字 而是一系列血压之后，这就是动态成分， 尽管我们必须始终将其保持在狭窄范围内。有哪些例子 可以改变体内平衡的内部因素？这主要涉及新陈代谢的变化。因此，如果 您进行类似运动的运动会增加新陈代谢，而如果您 睡觉会使您的新陈代谢减少。这是一个内部因素。外部因素是 几乎没有名字可言，这些都是来自外部环境的东西 影响身体。可能是外部，太阳或 从环境以及它如何影响我们的生理。可能会很冷，如何影响寒冷 我们的生理状况，或者处于压力状态，您会感到害怕或制定了 战斗或逃跑反应。这是另一个例子，我们现在需要处理的外部因素 在动态但始终如一的范围内，但保持超调变量。另一件事 我们需要牢牢把握的动态平衡是在什么水平上以及这个水平上 是一个组织层次。所以有原子，这些原子形成分子，然后形成更大的分子 分子，然后最终形成各种细胞成分，例如线粒体， 也可能是其他局部类型的细胞器。最后，我们有了单元。 该单元可能是我们真正需要维持的第一层组织 里面的环境，这就是任何内部的稳态环境 细胞。这调节着进入细胞的物质，调节着细胞质的溶解 将由组成。现在，每个单独的细胞被组合在一起形成一个组织。 在组织水平上，我们也有稳态调节作用，因此特定组织会调节 其中一些参数。器官系统还将调节体内平衡规范。器官 系统共同调节人体的各种体内平衡机制，例如血液和 最后，我们有了需要调节的整个有机体。所以从细胞，组织 器官，器官系统级别，最后是整个有机体，所有这些都需要 个人层面和公司层面的动态平衡。那怎么办？好一 调节体内平衡需要考虑的事情是，这全都基于我们的遗传学。所以 您在每个细胞中都有DNA，因此实际上细胞可以成为体内的任何组织。 恰好发生在当前时间是细胞和组织。所以当我们考虑 组织，器官，器官系统和生物体，我们必须始终意识到每个单独的细胞 经历自身的动态平衡，以及如何相互调节动态平衡 整个生物体的基本遗传密码 组织层次结构。因此，让我们将其重新组合成所有器官系统，然后 讨论此过程如何以集成方式工作。所以请记住你有类似 顶部的神经系统和底部的内分泌系统有助于 整个生物体的调节。肌肉骨骼，呼吸，心血管，肾脏 和GI系统正在帮助进行监管，并且某些监管在 性质意味着它是通过植物神经系统诱发的，其中一些是 行为的。因此，例如，如果天气太热，您可以做一些事情，例如坐在火中 和汗水来尝试调节您的体温，或者您可以简单地起身去 更凉爽的环境。这些是行为和自主反应之间的各种选择 可用来维持体内平衡的物质。我认为动态平衡的最后一个方面 最能帮助您思考的是使您能够 适应不同的环境或压力。最好通过以下方式制定 考虑器官系统可能会做什么。因此，在幻灯片一侧的示例中 这里您的血压升高。因此，如果血压升高，您需要 可以感觉到血压上升的信号，然后再传回心脏， 说“嘿，嘿，压力太大了。”我们要么不得不放慢脚步 特别的心。这可能会更加复杂，不仅仅是与拥有 压力增加和心脏减慢，而是多因素的。所以在这个 在下一个例子中，随着平均动脉血的增加，我们将显示相同的响应 压力感受器会感知到的血压，这些都是压力感受器 或压力感受器。然后将其反馈到脑干，在本例中为髓质。的 然后，髓质组织信息并将信号发送到心脏以及 血管。内心深处，它会发出一个信号，它应该放慢速度，不应该 跳得这么快，也不必灰心。最后对于血管，它会说 “嘿，你可以放松一点，你太紧张了，血压太高了。 系统需要扩张”，这种情况也会降低血压。这会导致两个 东西，心动过缓和血管舒张，并希望两者结合就足够了 将平均动脉血压降低到我们试图调节的值。 同样，这是一个动态的过程，但是我们正在寻找一个稳定的范围。

#### 03  控制和调节



因此，在这种情况下，我们将要调节一个变量。那个调节变量 有些东西会影响它。假设有一个外部压力源，这将 导致您的调节变量发生变化。你需要做什么？你怎么知道 变量是否太高？您体内需要安装各种传感器。就像我们 压力升高时有压力感受器。所以你有一个传感器，你可能有 多个传感器都将收集由该法规生成的数据 变量。现在您有了传感器来收集数据，它需要将其发送到某个地方 因为传感器本身无法确定要做什么。因此它将数据发送到集成 系统，有时甚至是一个协调系统，这将协调我们的响应 调整变量发生的变化，然后将信号发送到 效应器和这些效应器将能够改变或引起我们的改变 调节变量。因此，我们拥有这四类插脚系统 变量，传感器，积分器，协调中心和效应器都在尝试 确保我们的调节变量在一个内部被协调或调节的各个方面 各种范围。好吧，让我们回到我们的内心例子，尝试进一步梳理一下，如此 我们可以表示调节变量在哪里，传感器在哪里，在哪里 集成商和协调系统，以及我们的效应器将要成为的。所以我们将 看看下一张图。因此，我们系统中用于控制动脉血的传感器 压力将成为压力感受器。现在有许多不同的压力感受器 位于血管系统中的血液中或血液外部，而那些位于 颈动脉窦，它们在您的脖子上，主动脉弓位于左上方 心室或血液排出的地方。这些将使我们能够洞悉什么血液 压力是，但是请注意，您到处都没有压力感受器 位于关键地点。那么为什么这是关键？好吧，就主动脉弓而言， 在您将血液挤出到全身循环之后。所以你想知道什么 是心脏排出血液的压力。另一个关键因素是 知道血液流到大脑非常重要。所以你想拥有压力感受器 在颈动脉窦中能够吸收进入大脑的血压。那些是 将成为我们主要的受调节压力感受器。它们通过各种颅神经，迷走神经发送 主动脉弓为颅神经X或舌咽或颅神经IX为 颈动脉窦。他们被送到哪里？他们被送到延髓，这是我们的 整合中心。记住，当我们整合某些东西时，我们会抓住所有 信息，这是由称为NDS或核的特定脑干成分完成的 独尾。这是我们的聚会场所。您可以想到它，例如火车站 所有的信息都回到中心位置，以便我们知道信息在哪里 来自，但仅仅是因为信息正在返回，并不一定意味着 我们知道该怎么做，所以我们需要一些地方，这是一个协调中心 那将能够获取所有这些信息，并让我们决定如何处理它。所以在 以血压为例，我们可能有三个主要位置或效应器 完成。因此，我们有一个心脏减速区，这在副交感神经 系统。我们在交感神经系统中有心脏加速器系统， 交感神经系统中的血管收缩成分。这些是我们所要做的 可以换。那么，如果血压下降怎么办？

副交感神经 神经系统将试图减慢心脏的速度。那你如何减慢 减速器？好吧，你将不得不抑制它。因此，您正在禁止减速器。 您还将向必须做的心脏部分发出积极信号 心率加快，这会增加您的心率。您将增加收缩力。 您将增加发送到小动脉的信号，这些小动脉是血管的一部分 引起血管收缩。您将增加对静脉部分的信号 那也可以收缩。因此，在我们的示例中，我们向 窦房结来自交感神经系统，收缩力，小动脉和静脉。从 副交感神经系统，来自减速区的信号为负 这将使我们能够提高窦房结去极化率。那么这是什么意思 所有这些不同方面？这意味着我们将增加心率，增加 收缩力增加，血管收缩增加，静脉收缩增加 颈动脉窦发送给我们的信号是血压降低。 现在，我们可以想到一些病理生理学实例，这些实例会影响这些 循环，我要指出的其中之一是动脉粥样硬化或其他成分 我们可以想到的是衰老，因为这两种都会使压力感受器反应变钝 因为它们以使血管壁更硬的方式改变血管壁。如果有船只 墙更硬，发生的情况是它在响应时不会扩大或变大 血压变化。因此，如果血压升高，它将拉伸血管。 如果它拉伸血管，就会影响或引起周围神经的变化 该血管，因此，如果您有血管，并且您有正确的神经 在它旁边，当它扩张时，它将推动该神经，并将信号转换回 脑。在这种情况下，如果您的船只较硬，则通过的信息较少 僵硬的血管，因此您对反应的反应程度不同，因此可以更改 人在衰老或动脉粥样硬化中的压力感受器反应，这会影响您的 调节变量，例如动脉血压。

### 1479.Introduction to Physiology

> Define the field of physiology and identify its prominence in medicine
> Summarize the integrated organ systems approach of medical physiology

It's a science related to physics.
- The science that aims to understand the mechanisms of living systems, from the molecular to the complex structure of the body.
- A science that studies higher forms of life.
- The science that aims to understanding how the body gets sick.
- The science exclusively aimed at understanding how organs relate to each other.

Answer: B


00:00
Here we are going to talk about physiology and its general principles. Now you may be thinking at this point, well, what exactly is physiology. So let's address that first. Physiology is the science of life. Physiology is fairly broad in nature and it aims to understand the mechanisms of living and this incurs all the way from the genetic and molecular to the cell and to cell function and eventually into integrated behavior of the whole body. The other thing that's important to think about with physiology is it is how the body works under normal conditions.
00:41
Why this is important is later we're going to differentiate between normal physiology and medical physiology. Physiology is used in almost everything you do in daily life from whether you're walking or exercising, whether you're reading or whether you're watching this particular Lecturio lecture. It's done in just about everything. So let's also now define what is medical physiology and difference from regular physiology. In medical physiology, one of the quotes that I like best is done by an investigative team that first discovered what an arterial blood gas is and in this case they decided that critical care medicine is basically applying physiological principles to the care of the seriously ill patient. So in medical physiology, we will talk about some topics in greater detail and drill those down because they are more medically relevant. There are some topics in physiology, however, we will just explain the concept so you understand how this works but we won't drill it down in the same way because it's less medically important. Okay, now let's bring these topics together and go through which are the various areas or systems that we need to discuss. General physiology will be those things that undergo through all organ systems in the body. The nervous system will be the brain, the spinal cord and the nerves and these help control and regulate the other organ systems and those other organ systems include the musculoskeletal system. So in terms of the muscular system this would be the contractions of muscles, how they pull on skeletal levers so that you can ambulate, walk, do the various activities of normal daily living. However, to do normal activities you need to have metabolism. For metabolism, we need to have oxygen and that's where the respiratory system comes into play. Here, the respiratory system exchanges air between the environment and into the body and to the lungs, you will be able to then absorb oxygen and you will be able to eliminate CO2. How you get that oxygen around to all the cells in the body involves the cardiovascular system. So here, we will have the heart pumping blood. Now as it pumps blood throughout the body you need to have a vasculature or a tube system so it delivers blood throughout the whole body and every cell is in close enough diffusional distance to receive that oxygen. The renal system is very important in undergoing filtration of the blood.
03:31
So like the respiratory system was adding substances, the renal system will be removing metabolic excesses or substrates. The GI system is nice in that it adds back various nutrients as needed for the cells in the body such as glucose. Finally, the endocrine system will be another one of those control in regulation systems similar to the nervous system that help us integrate all the various organ systems in the body. So now let's discuss these organ systems and how they relate to each other in more of a flow diagram. Here you can see the body is set up in a number of different layers. The top layer we have here is the lungs and this is of course where the carbon dioxide will leave and oxygen will enter. Notice that the heart is split into two, the right side of the heart pumping blood in to the lungs, we have the left side of the heart moving that blood throughout the system. The renal system will be on the third rung and that's again our filtration system. On the second rung we have the gastrointestinal system and that will be once again the spot in which blood will come to pick up nutrients like glucose, proteins, fats so that then can be delivered to all the cells of the body. Finally at the lowest rung we have the capillary beds and that is to denote all the different cells in the body and how each one of them will receive this blood that has oxygen in it, has nutrients in it and is well filtered and so that can correspond to do the normal activities that are needed for that system, whether it be the nervous system, the musculoskeletal system or the endocrine system.

Answer:C

00:00
This is the process now that we need to discuss in terms of a central principle. The central principle of physiology is basically homeostasis but we all need to be on the same page of what homeostasis actually means. It is a regulated process by which a biological system maintains a dynamic but relatively consistent internal condition during various stresses or pressures incurred both from external and internal factors. That's a lot to think about so let's kind of deal through each of those processes a little bit more so we will understand what this definition is.
00:41
First thing to think about is what variables of the body are important enough for you to actually regulate them. If you think about this for a couple of seconds, one of them that comes to my mind is glucose. So you need to regulate the amount of glucose in the blood so that an optimal amount is delivered to each of the cells in the body. The same goes with oxygen.
01:09
Oxygen needs to be delivered to each cell in the body, it needs to be precisely regulated.
01:14
How do you make sure you get enough oxygen and glucose to the various spots in the body? You need to have enough blood pressure or pressure to push the blood to those various spots.
01:27
So those are 3 really good examples. Other ones that you might not have thought of yet include things like the regulation of body temperature, the regulation of pH balance are also integral variables that we need to regulate. Now, the other thing about the definition that I think we should discuss a little bit more that seems kinds of contradictory is that it's both a dynamic and consistent and what we mean by that. It's not going to be one particular number but rather a range of numbers that's going to be important in medicine. For example, a glucose level is not going to be one number but rather a range. Blood pressure is not just one number that we are after but rather a range of blood pressures and that is what is the dynamic component, although we have to consistently keep it within a narrow range. What are some examples of internal factors that can change homeostasis? This mainly involves changes in metabolism. So if you undergo something like exercise you have an increase in metabolism while if you are sleeping you have a decrease in metabolism. That's an internal factor. External factors are almost too great to even name, these are anything that will be from the external environment impacting the body. That can be something like heat generated from outside, from the sun or from the environment and how that impacts our physiology. It could be cold, how cold impacts our physiology or maybe in a stressful condition in which you are scared or you enacted the fight or flight response. That's another example, that external factor that we need to now deal with but maintain over regulated variables in a dynamic but consistent range. The other thing about homeostasis that we need to have a firm grasp on is at what level are we talking about and this level is a level of organization. So there are atoms and these form molecules which then form larger molecules and then finally form various cellular components like mitochondria in this case, it could be other local types of cellular organelles as well. Then finally we have the cell.
04:00
The cell is probably the first level of organization that we really need to maintain an environment in and this is the homeostatic environment of whatever is going to be within the cell. This is regulating what comes into the cell, it regulates what that cellular cytosol is going to be composed of. Now each individual cell though is combined together to form a tissue.
04:30
At the level of tissue, we also have a homeostatic regulation, so a particular tissue will regulate some of these parameters. Organ systems will also regulate a homeostatic norm. Organ systems together regulate the body's various homeostatic mechanism such as the blood and then finally we have the whole organism that needs to be regulated. So from the cell, tissue, organ, organ system level and finally the organism as a whole, all of these need to have homeostasis both at the individual level and the corporate level. So how is that done? Well one thing to think about with regulation of homeostasis is that it's all based upon our genetics. So you have DNA within each individual cell and so in fact a cell could become any tissue in the body.
05:31
It just so happens it is the cell and tissue that it is at the current time. So when we think about tissues, organ, organ system and organism, we have to always realize that each individual cell undergoes its own homeostasis and how that builds upon each other to regulate the homeostasis of the whole entire organism but the basic genetic code is in each cell of this overall hierarchy of organization. So let's bring it back together as all the organ systems and then discuss how this process works in an integrated fashion. So remember you have something like the nervous system at the top and the endocrine system at the bottom helping out with the regulation of the entire organism. The musculoskeletal, respiratory, cardiovascular, renal and GI systems are helping that regulation occur and some of the regulation is automatic in nature meaning that it's induced through the autonomic nervous system and some of it is behavioral. So for example if it's too hot out you can either do something like sit in the heat and sweat to try to regulate your body temperature or you can simply get up and go to a cooler environment. Those are the various choices between behavior and autonomic responses that are available to try to maintain homeostasis. The last aspect of homeostasis that I think will be most helpful to think about is what are the various components that allow you to regulate to a different environment or a different stressor. That can be best enacted by thinking about what an organ system might do. So in the example on the one side of your slide here you have an increase in blood pressure. So if blood pressure goes up, you need to have something to sense the blood pressure going up and then a signal coming back to the heart to say "Hey, hey that's too much pressure." We're going to either have to slow down that particular heart. This can be more complex to be not just one factor being involved with having an increase in pressure and a slowing down of the heart but rather be multifactorial. So in this next example we're going to show the same response with increase in mean arterial blood blood pressure that's going to be sensed by a pressure receptor and these are baroreceptors or pressure receptors. Then that is fed back to the brainstem, in this case the medulla. The medulla then organizes the information and sends the signal out both to the heart as well as the blood vessels. To the heart, it's going to send a signal that it should slow down, shouldn't beat so fast, it also doesn't have to be disheart. Finally for blood vessels, it's going to say "Hey you can relax a little bit, you're too tensed, there is too much blood pressure in the system you need to dilate" and this case that will also reduce blood pressure. This induces two things, a bradycardia and a vasodilation and hopefully those two in combination are enough to lower mean arterial blood pressure down to a value in which we are trying to regulate.
09:06
Again, this is a dynamic process but we're looking at a consistent range that we're looking for.

00:00
So in this case, we're going to have a variable that's regulated. That regulated variable, something will affect it. So let's say there is an external stressor out there and that's going to cause a change in your regulated variable. What you need to do? How do you know that variable is too high? You need to have various sensors in the body to pick that up. Just like we had baroreceptors when pressure was elevated. So you have a sensor and you may have multiple sensors that all are going to gather the data that is generated by this regulated variable. Now that you have the sensors garnering that data, it needs to send it somewhere because the sensor itself cannot determine what to do. So it sends the data to an integrated system or sometimes also a coordinating system and that is going to coordinate our response to that change that happened to our regulated variable and that signal is then sent to effectors and these effectors are going to be able to then change or cause an alteration in our regulated variable. So we have this four-kind of prong system where we have a regulated variable, sensors, an integrator and coordinating center and effectors all trying to do the various aspects of making sure our regulated variable is coordinated or regulated within a various range. Okay, let's go back to our heart example to try to tease this out further and so we can denote where our regulated variables are, where our sensors are, where our integrator and coordinating system are and what our effectors are going to be. So we will take a look at that in the next diagram. So our sensors in our system for controlling arterial blood pressure are going to be baroreceptors. Now there are a number of different baroreceptors located in the blood or just outside of the blood in the blood vessel system and those are in the carotid sinuses, they are here in your neck, your aortic arch which is just above the left ventricle or where the blood is pushed out. Those will allow us to give us insight into what blood pressure is but notice that you don't have baroreceptors everywhere, you just have them located in key spots. So why would this be key? Well in terms of the aortic arch, it's going to be right after you squeezed out the blood into the systemic circulation. So you want to know what is the pressure in which the heart is pushing out blood. The other key component to this is to know that the blood going to the brain is very important. So you'd want to have baroreceptors in the carotid sinuses to be able to pick up that blood pressure going to the brain. Those are going to be our main regulated baroreceptors. They are sent via various cranial nerves, vagus or cranial nerve X for the aortic arch and the glossopharyngeal or cranial nerve IX for the carotid sinuses. Where are they sent to? They are sent to the medulla and this is our integrating center. Remember when we integrate something, we are grabbing a hold of all the information and this is done from a specific brainstem component called the NDS or the nucleus tractus solitarus. This is our gathering area. You can think of it something like the train depot, all the information is coming back to a central location so that we know where the information is coming from but just because the information is coming back doesn't necessarily mean that we know what to do with it so we need to have some place and this is a coordinating center that is going to be able to take all these information and let us decide what to do with it. So in a blood pressure example, we have three main places or effectors that we might be able to accomplish. So we have a cardiac decelerator region and this is in the parasympathetic nervous system. We have a cardiac accelerator system in the sympathetic nervous system and a vasoconstrictor component in the sympathetic nervous system. These are the things which we can change. So what happens if you have an decrease in blood pressure? The parasympathetic nervous system is going to try to slow down the heart. So how do you slow down a decelerator? Well you're going to have to inhibit it. So you're inhibiting the decelerator.
04:51
You're also going to be giving a positive signal to the portions of the heart that have to do with heart rate and that increases your heart rate. You're going to increase your contractility.
05:07
You're going to increase the signal sent to your arterioles which are part of your blood vessels that cause vasoconstriction. You're going to increase the signal to the portions of the veins that can also venoconstrict. So in our example here, we have an increased signal to the sinoatrial node from the sympathetic nervous system, contractility, arterioles and veins. From the parasympathetic nervous system, we have a negative signal from the decelerator region which will allow us to increase the sinoatrial node depolarization rate. So what does this mean all these different aspects? It means we're going to get an increase in heart rate, an increase in contractility, an increase in vasoconstriction, increase in venoconstriction in response to the signal that was sent to us from the carotid sinuses and that was a decrease in blood pressure.

Now, there are pathophysiology examples that we can think of that will affect these regulated loops and one of the ones that I will just point out is atherosclerosis or another component that we could think of is aging because both of these can blunt baroreceptor responses because they change the vessel walls in such ways that the vessel walls are stiffer. If a vessel wall is stiffer, what happens is it doesn't distend as much or become bigger in responses to changes in blood pressure. So if blood pressure goes up, it should stretch the blood vessel.

If it stretches the blood vessel, it impacts or enacts changes in the nerve that's right around that blood vessel and therefore if you have a blood vessel and you have the nerve that's right next to it, as it distends it pushes on that nerve and will transduce the signal back to the brain. In this case if you have a stiffer vessel, less information travels through a stiff vessel and therefore you don't respond to the same extent and so you can change your person's baroreceptor responses in aging or in atherosclerosis and that impacts your ability to regulate a variable such as arterial blood pressure.
